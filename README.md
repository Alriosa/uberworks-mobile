  - `navigation`: Folder to store the navigators.
  - `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
    - `Screen`: Each screen should be stored inside its folder and inside it a file for its code and a separate one for the styles and tests.

      - `Screen.styles.js`
      - `Screen.test.js`
  - `theme`: Folder to store all the styling concerns related to the application theme.
